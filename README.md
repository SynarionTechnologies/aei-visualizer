# Autonomous and Evolutive Intelligence Framework (AEIF) Visualizer

AEIF Visualizer is an interactive 3D web dashboard designed to visualize, explore, and test neural networks built with the Autonomous and Evolutive Intelligence Framework (AEIF).  
This tool aims to provide developers and researchers with an intuitive way to observe, understand, and debug the inner workings of neural networks in real time.

The visualizer connects to the AEIF backend and displays neural architectures, activations, and network dynamics, making the AI more transparent and accessible.
